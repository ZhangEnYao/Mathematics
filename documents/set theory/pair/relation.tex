\Definition{
    Binary Relation
}{
    A set $A$ is a binary relation if all elements of $R$ are ordered pairs,
    i.e., if for any $z$ $\in$ $R$ there exist $x$ and $y$ such that $z$ $=$ $(x, y)$.
}
\Note{
    Relations between objects of two sorts called binary relations.
}
\Note{
    A binary relation is determined by specifying all ordered pairs of objects in that relation;
    it does not matter by what property the set of these ordered pairs is described.
}

\Definition{
    Inverse
}{
    Let $R$ be a binary relation.
    The inverse of $R$ is the set $$\Inverse{R}=\SetComprehension{z}{z=(x, y) \land  \QuantifierCondition{\exists}{x, y}{(y, x) \in R}}.$$
}

\Definition{
    Domain
}{
    Let $A$ be a binary relation.
    The set of all $x$ which are in relation $A$ with some $y$ is called the domain of $R$ and denoted by $\DomainFunction{dom}{R}$.
}
\Note{
    $\DomainFunction{dom}{R}$ is the set of all first coordinates of ordered pairs in $R$.
}
\Definition{
    Range
}{
    Let $A$ be a binary relation.
    The set of all $y$ such that, for some $x$, $x$ is in relation $R$ with $y$ is called the range of $A$, denoted by $\DomainFunction{ran}{R}$.
}
\Note{
    $\DomainFunction{ran}{R}$ is the set of all second coordinates of ordered pairs in $R$.
}
\Definition{
    Field
}{
    Let $A$ be a binary relation.
    The set $\DomainFunction{dom}{R}$ $\cup$ $\DomainFunction{ran}{R}$ is called the field of $R$ and is denoted by $\DomainFunction{field}{R}$.
    If $\DomainFunction{field}{R}$ $\subseteq$ $X$, we say that $R$ is a relation in $X$ or that $R$ is a relation between elements of $X$.
}
\Proposition{}{
    Both $\DomainFunction{dom}{R}$ and $\DomainFunction{ran}{R}$ exist for any relation $R$.
}{
    Obviously.
}

\Definition{
    Image
}{
    The image of $A$ under $R$ is the set of all $y$ from the range of $R$ related in $R$ to some element of $A$; it is denoted by $R[A]$.
}
\Definition{
    Inverse Image
}{
    The inverse image of $B$ under $R$ is the set of all $x$ from the domain of $R$ related in $R$ to some element of $B$; it is denoted by $\Inverse{R}[A]$.
}
\Proposition{}{
    $\DomainFunction{dom}{R}$ $=$ $\DomainFunction{ran}{\Inverse{R}}$.
}{
    Obviously
}
\Proposition{}{
    The inverse image of $B$ under $R$ is equal to the image of $B$ under $\Inverse{R}$.
}{
    Obviously
}

\Definition{
    Composition
}{
    Let $R$ and $S$ be binary relations.
    The composition of $R$ and $S$ is the relation.
    $$ \Compose{S}{R} = \SetComprehension{(x, z)}{\QuantifierCondition{\exists}{y}{(x, y) \in R \land (y, z) \in S}}$$.
}
\Note{
    $(x, z)$ $\in$ $\Compose{S}{R}$ means that for some $y$, $(x, y) \in R$ and $(y, z) \in S$.
