Various general mathematical concepts, such as relations, functions, and orderings can be represented by ordered pairs.
\Definition{
    Ordered Pair,
    Coordinate
}{
    Ordered pair of $a$ and $b$ is denoted by $(a, b)$;
    $a$ is the first coordinate of the pair, $b$ is the second coordinate.
    $(a, b) = \Set{\Set{a}, \Set{a,b}}$.
}
\Property{}{
    $(a, b) \neq (b, a)$ if $a \neq b$.
}{
    Obviously.
}
\Property{}{
    If $a = b$, then $(a, a) = \Set{\Set{a}}$ has only one element.
}{
    Obviously.
}
\Note{
    Ordered pair should be defined in such a way that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their first coordinates are equal and their second coordinates are equal.
}
\Note{
    If $a \neq b$, $(a, b)$ has two elements, a singleton $\Set{a}$ and an unordered pair $\Set{a, b}$.
    The first coordinate is the element of $\Set{a}$; the second coordinate is the other element of $\Set{a, b}$.
}
\Theorem{}{
    $(a, b)= (a', b')$ if and only if $a = a'$ and $b = b'$.
}{
    Obviously.
}

\Definition{
    One-Tuples
}{
    $(a) = a$.
}
\Definition{
    Ordered Triples
}{
    $(a, b, c) = ((a, b), c)$.
