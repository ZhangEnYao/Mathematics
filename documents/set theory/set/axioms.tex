\Axiom{
	Extensionality
}{
	If every element of X is an element of Y and every element of Y is an element of X, then X = Y.

\Definition{
	Empty, Vacuous Set
}{
	The (unique) set with no elements is called the empty, vacuous set and is denoted {$\emptyset$}.
}
\Axiom{
	Comprehension
}{
	Let P(x) be a property of x. For any set A, there is a set B such that x {$\in$} B if and only if x {$\in$} A and P(x).
}
\Note{
	For any sets p, {\dots}, q and any A, there is a set B (depending on p, {\dots}, q and, of course, on A) consisting exactly of all those x {$\in$} A for which P(x, p, {\dots}, q).

	For every A, there is only one set B such that x {$\in$} B if and only if x {$\in$} A and P(x).

\Axiom{
	Pair
}{
	For any A and B, there is a set C such that x {$\in$} C if and only if x = A or x = B.
}
\Note{
	A {$\in$} C and B {$\in$} C, and there are no other elements of C.
}
\Property{}{
	The set C is unique.

\Definition{
	Unordered Pair
}{
	Unordered pair of A and B as the set having exactly A and B as its elements.

}{
	For any set S, there exists a set U such that x {$\in$} U if and only if x {$\in$} A for some A {$\in$} S.

}
\Property{}{
	The set P is uniquely determined.

	Obviously.
}
\Note{
	We call the set of all subsets of S the power set of S and denote it by {$\mathcal{P}(S)$}.
